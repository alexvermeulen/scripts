# Scripts

This repository is the home of any miscellaneous scripts I've created.

#### `macSetup.sh`
The intent is for this script to eventually install and setup all the packages and applications I use on my Mac.
At this time is does the following
* Installs command line tools
* Installs homebrew and any applications/packages in `$HOME/.Brewfile`
